      # Note: CI deletes package-lock.json before install due to npm bug with optional dependencies
      # across platforms (https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828). Mac-generated lock file lacks
      # Linux optional deps (@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu), causing CI failures even with npm install.
      # 
      # Security trade-off: Dependencies not pinned in CI (supply-chain risk), but package-lock.json
      # is still committed for local dev reproducibility. This is a known limitation until npm fixes
      # the upstream bug. For Janee's threat model, the risk is acceptable:
      # - Small project with manageable dependencies
      # - Dependencies reviewed locally (where lock file works)
      # - Alternative would be no CI testing, which is worse
      #
      # Documented in #17.
