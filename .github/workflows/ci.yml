      # Note: Using `npm install` instead of `npm ci` due to npm bug with optional dependencies
      # across platforms (https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828). package-lock.json is still
      # committed for local reproducibility, but CI regenerates it on Linux to include correct
      # platform-specific optional deps (e.g., @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu).
      # Security trade-off documented in #17.
