# Janee 🔐

**Secrets management for AI agents via MCP**

---

## The Problem

AI agents need API access to be useful. The current approach is to give them your keys and hope they behave.

- 🔓 Agents have full access to Stripe, Gmail, databases
- 📊 No audit trail of what was accessed or why
- 🚫 No kill switch when things go wrong
- 💉 One prompt injection away from disaster

---

## The Solution

Janee is an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that manages API secrets for AI agents:

1. **Store your API keys** — encrypted locally in `~/.janee/`
2. **Run `janee serve`** — starts MCP server
3. **Agent requests access** — via `execute` MCP tool
4. **Janee injects the real key** — agent never sees it
5. **Everything is logged** — full audit trail

**Your keys stay on your machine. Agents never see them. You stay in control.**

---

## Configure Once, Use Everywhere

Set up your APIs in Janee once:

```yaml
services:
  stripe:
    baseUrl: https://api.stripe.com
    auth: { type: bearer, key: sk_live_xxx }
  github:
    baseUrl: https://api.github.com
    auth: { type: bearer, key: ghp_xxx }
  openai:
    baseUrl: https://api.openai.com
    auth: { type: bearer, key: sk-xxx }
```

Now **every agent** that connects to Janee can use them:

- **Claude Desktop** — access your APIs
- **Cursor** — access your APIs  
- **OpenClaw** — access your APIs
- **Any MCP client** — access your APIs

No more copying keys between tools. No more "which agent has which API configured?" Add a new agent? It already has access to everything. Revoke a key? Update it once in Janee.

**One config. Every agent. Full audit trail.**

---

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @true-and-useful/janee
```

### Initialize

```bash
janee init
```

This creates `~/.janee/config.yaml` with example services.

### Add Services

**Option 1: Interactive (recommended for first-time users)**

```bash
janee add
```

Janee will guide you through adding a service:

```
Service name: stripe
Base URL: https://api.stripe.com
Auth type (bearer/hmac/headers): bearer
API key: sk_live_xxx

✓ Added service "stripe"

Create a capability for this service? (Y/n): y
Capability name (default: stripe): 
TTL (e.g., 1h, 30m): 1h
Auto-approve? (Y/n): y

✓ Added capability "stripe"

Done! Run 'janee serve' to start.
```

**Option 2: Edit config directly**

Edit `~/.janee/config.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  stripe:
    baseUrl: https://api.stripe.com
    auth:
      type: bearer
      key: sk_live_xxx

capabilities:
  stripe:
    service: stripe
    ttl: 1h
    autoApprove: true
```

### Start the MCP server

```bash
janee serve
```

### Use with your agent

Agents that support MCP (Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenClaw) can now call the `execute` tool to make API requests through Janee:

```typescript
// Agent calls the execute tool
execute({
  service: "stripe",
  method: "GET",
  path: "/v1/balance",
  reason: "User asked for account balance"
})
```

Janee decrypts the key, makes the request, logs everything, and returns the response.

---

## OpenClaw Integration

If you're using [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), install the plugin for native tool support:

```bash
npm install -g @true-and-useful/janee
janee init
# Edit ~/.janee/config.yaml with your services

# Install the OpenClaw plugin
openclaw plugins install @true-and-useful/janee-openclaw
```

Enable in your agent config:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [{
      id: "main",
      tools: { allow: ["janee"] }
    }]
  }
}
```

Your agent now has these tools:

- `janee_list_services` — Discover available APIs
- `janee_execute` — Make API requests through Janee

The plugin spawns `janee serve` automatically. All requests are logged to `~/.janee/logs/`.

**See [docs/OPENCLAW.md](docs/OPENCLAW.md) for full integration guide.**

---

## MCP Tools

Janee exposes two MCP tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_services` | Discover available APIs and their policies |
| `execute` | Make an API request through Janee |

Agents discover what's available, then call APIs through Janee. Same audit trail, same protection.

---

## Configuration

Config lives in `~/.janee/config.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  host: localhost

services:
  stripe:
    baseUrl: https://api.stripe.com
    auth:
      type: bearer
      key: sk_live_xxx  # encrypted at rest

  github:
    baseUrl: https://api.github.com
    auth:
      type: bearer
      key: ghp_xxx

capabilities:
  stripe:
    service: stripe
    ttl: 1h
    autoApprove: true

  stripe_sensitive:
    service: stripe
    ttl: 5m
    requiresReason: true
```

**Services** = Real APIs with real keys  
**Capabilities** = What agents can request, with policies

---

## Request Policies

Control exactly what requests each capability can make using `rules`:

```yaml
capabilities:
  stripe_readonly:
    service: stripe
    ttl: 1h
    rules:
      allow:
        - GET *
      deny:
        - POST *
        - PUT *
        - DELETE *

  stripe_billing:
    service: stripe
    ttl: 15m
    requiresReason: true
    rules:
      allow:
        - GET *
        - POST /v1/refunds/*
        - POST /v1/invoices/*
      deny:
        - POST /v1/charges/*  # Can't charge cards
        - DELETE *
```

**How rules work:**

1. **`deny` patterns are checked first** — explicit deny always wins
2. **Then `allow` patterns are checked** — must match to proceed
3. **No rules defined** → allow all (backward compatible)
4. **Rules defined but no match** → denied by default

**Pattern format:** `METHOD PATH`

- `GET *` → any GET request
- `POST /v1/charges/*` → POST to /v1/charges/ and subpaths
- `* /v1/customers` → any method to /v1/customers
- `DELETE /v1/customers/*` → DELETE any customer

**This makes security real:** Even if an agent lies about its "reason", it can only access the endpoints the policy allows. Enforcement happens server-side.

## CLI Reference

```bash
janee init             # Set up ~/.janee/ with example config
janee add              # Add a service (interactive)
janee add stripe -u https://api.stripe.com -k sk_xxx  # Add with args
janee remove <service> # Remove a service
janee list             # List configured services
janee serve            # Start MCP server
janee logs             # View audit log
janee logs -f          # Tail audit log
janee sessions         # List active sessions
janee revoke <id>      # Kill a session
```

### Non-interactive Setup (for AI agents)

AI agents can't respond to interactive prompts. Use `--*-from-env` flags to read credentials from environment variables — this keeps secrets out of the agent's context window:

```bash
# Bearer auth (Stripe, OpenAI, etc.)
janee add stripe -u https://api.stripe.com --auth-type bearer --key-from-env STRIPE_KEY

# HMAC auth (Bybit)
janee add bybit --auth-type hmac-bybit --key-from-env BYBIT_KEY --secret-from-env BYBIT_SECRET

# HMAC auth with passphrase (OKX)
janee add okx --auth-type hmac-okx --key-from-env OKX_KEY --secret-from-env OKX_SECRET --passphrase-from-env OKX_PASS
```

When all required credentials are provided via flags, Janee:
- Never opens readline (no hanging on stdin)
- Auto-creates a capability with sensible defaults (1h TTL, auto-approve)

You can also edit `~/.janee/config.yaml` directly if you prefer.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌─────────┐
│  AI Agent   │─────▶│  Janee   │─────▶│  Stripe │
│             │ MCP  │   MCP    │ HTTP │   API   │
└─────────────┘      └──────────┘      └─────────┘
      │                   │
   No key           Injects key
                    + logs request
```

1. Agent calls `execute` MCP tool with service, method, path
2. Janee looks up service config, decrypts the real key
3. Makes HTTP request to real API with key
4. Logs: timestamp, service, method, path, status
5. Returns response to agent

Agent never touches the real key.

---

## Security

- **Encryption**: Keys stored with AES-256-GCM
- **Local only**: MCP server over stdio (no network exposure)
- **Audit log**: Every request logged to `~/.janee/logs/`
- **Sessions**: Time-limited, revocable
- **Kill switch**: `janee revoke` or delete config

---

## Integrations

Works with any agent that speaks MCP:

- **OpenClaw** — Native plugin (`@true-and-useful/janee-openclaw`)
- **Cursor** — [Setup guide](/docs/cursor.md)
- **Claude Code** — [Setup guide](/docs/claude-code.md)
- **Codex CLI** — [Setup guide](/docs/codex.md)
- **Any MCP client** — just point at `janee serve`
